## Technologies

* Around 85% of our code has been written in vanilla JavaScript alongside some HTML5 and CSS for the GUI(graphic user interface).
* We used jQuery(a JavaScript library) in order to make the game logic communicating with the user inputs(through the GUI).
* To test our app we used Jasmine(open source testing framework for JavaScript).
* To check our test coverage we used Istanbul(a Node.js module) and Coverall.io(a website hosting GitHub repositories and checking for your coverage percentage after every merge).
* We also used ESlint as linter(a tool to analyze your code to flag bugs and stylistic errors).

## Story

![Alt text](/static/images/hero.png?raw=true "hero")

'You wake up in a dark place. Your eyes slowly adjust, and you see a dagger next to you. While you're picking it up,
you suddenly hear something coming from the darkness! You're still trying to understand what happened the night before when...'

In this game the Hero has to escape a multiple room dungeon. But his skills will be hard tested by a series of fights along his journey towards the light!
To help our protagonist in his quest we will have the chance to improve our armour and our weapons as well as our skills...
But don't be deceived by this! Your journey will still be long and full of blood!!!
<!-- In the first room is a monster. If the player successfully defeats this monster (with a turn-based, RPG style combat system), the player will move into the final room where they escape and win the game. -->
